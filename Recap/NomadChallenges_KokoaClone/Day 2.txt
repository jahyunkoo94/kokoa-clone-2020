#2.4 Tag Attributes

<a> tag means anchor, like link.
Anchor is basically a way going to another website.
href attribute means HTTP reference. href can only be combine with anchor.
target attribute determines where href is opened.
ex) <a href="http://goggle.com">Go to google.com</a>

Attributes is basically add information to a text.
Any attributes can be added.
But the browser is not going to understand not exist attributes.
attributes can only be combine with the tag that has that attribute.
some tags share attribute. some tags do not.

<img src="" alt="" /> is img tag.
it doesn't have closing tag like </img>. 
it is self closing tag. looks like this <img />
because img doesn't have content.
the only img tag has src attribute. 
the src need image source link and puts it in the image

#2.5 More Tags and Head

local image source should be write path notation like <img src="img/logo.img" />

HTML has rule that must be followed.
1. first line must be <!DOCTYPE html>
    it means informing the browser that this file is HTML file
2. between <html> and </html> is going to be html code
3. websites have two parts. head and body
    - head is where configure the website. do setting invisible settings.
        ex) <title>Home - My first website.</title> is shown title on tab 
    - body is where the content is shown we puts on the website. 

#2.6 Its All About the Head 

<meta> tags are means extra data. they have two attribute. name and content.
meta tags are self closing tags.
every tag on the head is invisible.

#2.7 More Tags

Use MDN when search html,css,js

Do not memorize all tags and attributes!

#2.8 Form Tags 

<form> tag is submiting information group of input or file ...
input tag has many types.
we can find tags in MDN.

#2.9 More Tags and IDs

label works together with the input.
<input> tag should have id attribute. for="" in label and id="" in input must be same.
if click the label we can type in input.

id must be unique in the whole document.
the purpose using id is to identify the element when using scripting or css.
so all element have only one id.

#2.10 Semantic HTML

<div> tag is like a box.
boxes can not exist next to each other.

Semantic tag means basically the meaning tracking by looking a document
ex) <header>, <main>, <footer>, <address>...
those tags equal <div>. but we can easily understand the meaning.

<span> is for short text
<p> means paragraph. it is for long text.

#2.11 Recap

HTML is the bone. CSS is the muscle. Javascript is the brain.
HTML is made of tags. browser can't understand undefined tag.

Tag consist of opening tag and closing tag.
A closing tag starts with "/" and must be same words as opening tag
ex) <div> </div>

tags can have many attributes. 
Attributes must always use double quotes. 
ex) <div id="box"> </div>

any tags have id.
some attribute can be used for every tags. but some attribute can be used for certain tag.

<div> is most generic box container.
but we want to have meaning when we writing the code and understand by read the code.
so we need to use segmantic tag.

head is configure the website. it is invisible on website.

use more often tags are <header>, <main>, <footer>, <navigation>, <sidebar>,
